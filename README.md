# PhotoCode
Do you like plants? If yes, check out my program which tries simulate photosynthesis in chloroplast!
PhotoCode is a python program made to help people understand all processes of photosynthesis in a simple way.

## How it works? 
The vegetal cells of plants have a organelle called "chloroplast". In this organelle, happens the photosynthesis,
more specifically in the thylakoid membrane (represented by these green discs) in the stroma (fluid surrounding the thylakoid).

In thylakoid membrane, there is photosystems composed by photosynthetic pigments that absorve solar radiation. This solar radiation
allows the photolysis of water, where water is decomposed into electrons, hydrogen ions and oxygen. The electrons are used in the reduction 
of organic compounds, the hydrogen ions allow a concentration gradient that is used in the production of ATP and the oxygen subproduct of the process.

This all processes can be visualized in this image.

Photosystems act like chargers, water act like batteries and hydrogen ions act like a balance of gradient. All this 
factors influence the synthesis of ATP and NADPH (electron transport molecule)

Now in stroma, happens the Calvin Circle. All the processes can be visualized in this image.

The wave length is also a factor which influence the photosynthesis. The photosynthetic pigments in photosystems 
absorve certain radiations due to wave length. There is an absorption spectrum of the three photosynthetic pigments used in the
program.
